<p>I am the course convenor of Global Perspectives. I have specialist knowledge relating to nineteenth-century Irish immigration in England, which formed the basis of my PhD. My research interests have remained in Irish diasporic history in the textile-producing regions of northern England, broadly defined and located principally in the second half of the nineteenth and opening decades of the twentieth centuries. I have ten years’ experience teaching GCSE, IGCSE, GCE and IBDP History; Politics Philosophy; Religious Studies; and Theory of Knowledge. In addition to this, I have seven years’ experience teaching History to undergraduate students at Royal Holloway University of London, the University of Nottingham, Ningbo, China, and the University of Huddersfield.</p>
<p>My hobbies include off-shore and coastal sailing (racing), fell walking, outdoor pursuits, and archery. I enjoy independent travel and have travelled extensively throughout the world. I am also a qualified archaeologist and have excavated in Israel, Kazakhstan, and Egypt.</p></div>

<p>I am the coordinator for the Science strand of the Foundation Year. I have a PhD in Theoretical Physics from Imperial College. I’m mainly interested in trying to make sense of quantum theory, but also black holes, dark matter, and all that. My undergraduate degree was in Physics at Imperial College. I’ve since worked as a researcher at the University of Sussex, Imperial College, and the University of Oxford. I’ve also worked in the financial industry as a ‘quant’.</p>
<p>In my spare time I like to ride my bike, play my guitar, and learn Italian, but not all at the same time.</p><br><br><br></div>

<p>I teach on the Sciences strand of the Foundation Year. My PhD was on the parasite which causes African Sleeping Sickness, at the University of Edinburgh. This involved a mix of 'wet-lab' work and bioinformatics – using computer programming to analyse DNA. I did my undergraduate in Genetics and Microbiology at the University of Sheffield, where I worked part-time in food safety and STI testing laboratories.</p>
<p>I'm really passionate about student wellbeing and am trained in Mental Health First Aid. I'm also open about my own experiences with anxiety, depression and taking anti-depressants so feel free to ask me anything. I offer 1:1 sessions with any student who asks all year round, so if you need support then click the link above!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also love languages and I've been learning Spanish since 2017 and Gujarati since 2022, although I'm still far from fluent. I grew up thinking language learning was impossible, so I'm really happy with my progress. I also love travelling - my favourite adventures include seeing a tapir in the wild, swimming with bioluminescent plankton and hitchhiking from Sheffield to Romania!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have been teaching in the Further and Higher Education sectors for over 20 years. Prior to teaching, I worked as a professional stand-up comedian under the name ‘Buddy Hell’ on the London and national circuits until 1999 when I began a PGCE (Post-16) at the Institute of Education, UCL. When I started teaching in Further Education, it had been my intention to teach drama and performing arts. However, because of a shortage of Media Lecturers who specialised in critical theory, I ended up teaching the theoretical modules on the AVCE, GNVQ and A Level Media Studies courses. In 2005, While I was working on my PhD, I worked as a Lecturer on the BA (Hons) Media and Communications, BA (Hons) Psychosocial Studies and Foundation Sociology courses. I joined the Integrated Foundation Year as Teaching Fellow (Humanities) in September 2019.</div>

<p>After failing my A-Levels (twice), I chose to return to education as a mature student. I studied at Ruskin College, Oxford and then the universities of Warwick and Birmingham, collecting all those letters after my name. I am a strong believer in both life-long learning and foundation teaching, having found my own successes through second-chance education.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As well as being a teacher for twelve years, I am also an editor, which means I work closely with writers to develop their novels to a professional standard. My academic speciality is short fiction, but I also cover areas as diverse as: post-war dystopian fiction, the history of games and competition, modernist art, digital philosophies, and visual methodologies. I also write short fiction of my own and paint portraits in my spare time, when I get any.</p></div>

<p>I am one of the Sciences Teaching Fellows. I did my PhD research in Material Physics at the University of Warwick, after doing an MSc in Medical Physics and a BSc Special Honours degree in Physics with Mathematics from the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. After graduating I started working as an assistant lecturer in Physics at the University of Peradeniya Sri Lanka and then continued as a lecturer in Physics at the Open University of Sri Lanka. Before joining Royal Holloway, I worked at Into City University of London.</p>
<p>My research interests are based on processing of ceramic materials with a particular focus on understanding their structure and functional properties. My primary research was on synthesising doped and undoped zircon based ceramics and using different characterisation techniques such as X-Ray diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance in order to understand their structure and related properties.</p>

<p>I am involved in teaching python programming and mathematics in the foundation programme. I have a MSc in Computer Science from Wolverhampton University. I also have an undergraduate degree in Computing and Information Systems from University of London, Goldsmith College.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am very passionate about coding, and I love learning about new technologies. In spare time, I enjoy reading and cooking.&nbsp;</p><br></div>

<p>I teach on the Humanities strand of the Integrated Foundation Degree. I am currently undertaking doctoral research on nineteenth-century German migration to Britain, but have a wide range of academic interests, including rhetoric/composition studies, applied linguistics, and, more recently, a burgeoning interest in the environmental humanities and ecocritical approaches to literature. I have published in academic journals and have recently guest edited a special issue of Journal of Academic Writing.</p>
<p>My own background and educational history make me a firm believer in both learning for life and improving access to higher education: certainly, had the Foundation Degree existed in the late 90s when I was a somewhat out-of-depth undergraduate, I would have signed up very quickly indeed!</p>
<p>As well as being a university teacher with over fifteen years of classroom experience, I like to write and edit. When I am not fulfilling my other passion of running, I enjoy time with family, reading difficult texts, and writing bad poetry.</p></div>

<p>I have taught English and comparative literature and culture at post-16 and undergraduate level for over 20 years, including at Queen Mary University, at several London sixth form colleges, and at an international school in India. I am committed to student-centered learning and to a holistic approach that values mental health and neurodiversity.</p>
<p>I research and write about early-twentieth century literature, democracy and education. I am particularly interested in the American avant-garde writer Gertrude Stein (the subject of my PhD and recent book) and the world of radical artists and writers she joined when she moved to Paris in 1903. She and her friends and acquaintances, taking advantage of the freedom Paris offered, challenged cultural and social norms in their creative work and in their ways of life. Sometimes their experiments were admirable, but sometimes they were very problematic, and this is the tricky ground my research explores.</p></div>

<p>I teach on the new science strand of the Foundation Year- Biological Sciences. Having completed my PhD here at Royal Holloway in entomology in 2007, I have worked in the Biological Sciences Department as a researcher and visiting lecturer since, researching both the development of pheromones to monitor endangered species of beetle and, more recently, a schools-based ecology project. I have also worked for the last 20 years as an A level Biology tutor. I love all aspects of biology and am looking forward to working with students as they begin their careers as tomorrow’s biologists.</p><br><br><br></div>

<p>I am an historian of modern Britain and my research focuses on the history of childhood. My publications to date explore the lived experience of early twentieth century British childhoods with a particular focus on war, education, the family, games and play. I am interested in the process of memory and the relationship between an individual and their past and my work uses memoir and autobiography as well as children’s writing and their material culture to explore the lives of those often ignored by the historical record.</p>
<p>I love teaching and have been working in higher education for the last 15 years teaching on foundation, undergraduate and postgraduate programmes. I joined Royal Holloway this year and teach on the Humanities strand of the Foundation Programme.</p>
<p>My two daughters keep me pretty busy when I’m not at work, but when I do get some spare time I go running. I’m taking on the challenge of the London Marathon this year – ask me how I got on after October 2nd (eek!)</p>
